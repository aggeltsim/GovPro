## Reporting a Vulnerability

We value the work of security researchers and the community in keeping **GovPro** secure. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow the process below.

### How to Report
**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.** Instead, please send a detailed report to our security team:
* **Email:** [xxxxx063@aueb.gr]


In your report, please include:
1. A brief summary of the vulnerability.
2. The affected version(s).
3. Step-by-step instructions (or a Proof of Concept script) to reproduce the issue.
4. Potential impact if exploited.

### What to Expect
Once you have submitted a report, you can expect the following timeline:
* **Acknowledgement:** We will receive the report and will thank you for the interest in our application.
* **Triage:** Our team will validate the finding and determine the severity.
* **Updates:** We will provide an update on the status of the fix at least.
* **Resolution:** Once a fix is verified, we will coordinate a release and, where appropriate, credit you for the discovery.

### Disclosure Policy
We ask that you practice **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure**. Please do not share information about the vulnerability with the public or any third party until we have had a reasonable amount of time to develop and release a patch for our users.

## Security Hardening
For production deployments of **GovPro**, we recommend:
* Enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
* Running the application on an isolated network/VPC.
